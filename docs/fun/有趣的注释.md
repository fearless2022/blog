## 只有上帝知道

* ```java
  // When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing
  // 
  // Now, God only konws
  ```

## 相隔时空的diss

* ```java
  // somedev1 - 6/7/02 Adding temporary tracking of Login screen
  // somedev2 - 5/22/07 Temporary my ass
  ```

## 喝大了

* ```java
  // Drunk, fix later.
  ```

## 别碰，有魔法

* ```java
  // Magic. Do not touch.
  ```

## 开心吗？

* ```java
  // Happy debugging suckers
  ```

## 糊弄过去算了

* ```java
  /**
   * You may think you know what the following code does.
   * But you don't. Trust me.
   * Fiddle with id, and you'll spend many a sleepless night cursing the moment you thought you'd be clever enough 
   * to "optimize" the code below.
   * Now close this file and go play with something else.
   */
  ```

## 你懂的

* ```java
  // This code sucks, you know it and I know it.
  ```

## 先往下看

* ```java
  // Move on and call me an idiot later.
  ```

## 好怕怕

* ```java
  // I am not sure if we need this, but too scared to delete.
  ```

## 到底要怎样

* ```java
  /** 
   * To understand recursion, see the bottom of this file
   * At the bottom of the file:
   * To understand recursion, see the top of this file
   */
  ```

## 本人对本代码概不负责

* ```java
  // I am not responsible of this code.
  // They made me write it, against my will.
  ```

## 我偏不

* ```java
  // No comments for you.
  // It was hard to write.
  // So it should be hard to read.
  ```

## 没有错，不好用就不是我写的

* ```java
  // I this code works, it was written by Paul Dilascia. If not, I don't know who wrote it.
  ```

## 没毛病

* ```java
  // This formula is right, work out the math yourself if you don't believe me.
  ```

## 就问你服不服

* ```java
  // Remove this if you wanna be fired.
  ```

## 好好活着

* ```java
  // If I from the future read this I'll back in time and kill myself.
  ```

## 谨以此代码献给我的妻子

* ```java
  // I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my wife, Darlene, who will have to support me and our three children and the dog once it gets released into the public.
  ```

## 我读书少，别骗我

* ```java
  // If this comment is removed the program will blow up.
  ```

## 你可能看不懂这个

* ```java
  // You are not expected to understand this.
  ```

## 新人默默的在后面增加一行注释：浪费在这里的总时间=48h

* ```java
  /**
   * Dear maintainer:
   *
   * Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine, and have realized what a terrible mistake that was, 
   * please increment the following counter as a warning to the next guy:
   *
   * total_hours_wasted_here = 48
   */
